# Deploy-a-high-availability-web-app-using-CloudFormation

## In this project : 
>Iâ€™ll deploy web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. Write the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Instagram-like app from the ground up. I will begin with deploying the networking components, followed by servers, security roles and software. 
>So, for that reason, I have chosen a scenario where I deploy an application (Apache Web Server) and I also pick up code (JavaScript and HTML) from S3 Storage and deploy it in the appropriate folder on the web server.

### There will be two parts to this project:
1.Diagram:  a diagram as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.
2.Script (Template and Parameters)
